Installation:

   - install JDK
   - install JRE

System requirements:
Java 8

About forking:
    As far as I know in Java there is no other way to fork a process except for running new instance of an application.
    Thant why in my case the second application would look the same as a first one

Running:
1. download FirstApp.jar
2. open command line
3. run application: java -jar FirstApp.jar
4. you can see all log's files in the folder where FirstApp.jar was saved.
5. every new process create log's file.
